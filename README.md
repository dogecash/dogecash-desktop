## About

DogeCash Desktop is our feature-rich flagship client, recommended for most users for interacting with DogeCash network.

We provide a decentralized privacy platform with a suite of tools to enhance your online privacy:

* **An anonymous cryptocurrency** – send and receive the PART cryptocurrency without revealing the transaction history
* **End-to-end encrypted messaging** – communicate in a secure and decentralized manner without revealing your IP address
* **A private marketplace** – buy and sell goods without leaving a trace (WIP on `market` branch)
* **Community governance** – anyone can submit proposals to DogeCash network via decentralized voting & governance (WIP on `market` branch)

This repository is the user interface that works in combination with our [`particl-core`](https://github.com/particl/particl-core).

## Getting started

### Requirements

* [Node.js®](https://nodejs.org/) 6.4—7.10
* [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/particl/particl-desktop
cd particl-desktop
yarn install
```

### Development

> Note: most recent development happens on `market` branch

1. Run `ng serve` to start the dev server and keep it running
1. In another terminal window, run `yarn run start:electron:dev -testnet --devtools` to start DogeCash Desktop on testnet (daemon will be updated and launched automatically)
   * `-testnet` – for running on testnet (omit for running the client on mainnet)
   * `-reindex` – reindexes the blockchain (in case you're stuck)
   * `--devtools` – automatically opens Developer Tools on client launch

#### Interact with particl-core daemon

You can directly interact with the daemon ran by the Electron version.

```
./particl-cli -testnet getblockchaininfo
```

### Packaging

#### Windows-only requirements

Building for Windows requires the 32-bit libraries to be available:

```
sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib
sudo apt-get install g++-multilib
```

#### Packaging commands

* `yarn run package:win` – Windows
* `yarn run package:mac` – macOS
* `yarn run package:linux` – Linux


## Troubleshooting

### Development issues

#### Blockchain syncing stuck
Restart the app with `-reindex` flag:

```
yarn run start:electron:dev -testnet --devtools -reindex
```

#### Marketplace fails to load
Delete marketplace `database` folder and restart app:

* Windows: `%appdata%\particl-market\testnet\`
* macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/DogeCash/particl-market/testnet/`
* Linux: `~/.particl-market/testnet/`
